## Introduction

R Markdown is built into RStudio and allows you to create documents like HTML, PDF, and Word documents from R. With R Markdown, you can embed R code into your documents. 

### Why use R Markdown?
- Turn work in R into more accessible formats
- Incorporate R code and R plots into documents
- R Markdown documents are reproducible -- the source code gets rerun every time a document is generated, so if data change or source code changes, the output in the document will change with it. 

## Getting Started

- Create a new R Markdown file in RStudio by going to  
File > New File > R Markdown...
- Click the "presentation" tab
- Enter a title, author, and select what kind of slideshow you ultimately want (this can all be changed later)

## Getting Started
The beginning of an R Markdown file looks like this:<br><br>
`---`  
`title: "Air Quality"`  
`author: "JHU"`  
`date: "May 17, 2016"`  
`output: html_document`  
`---`<br><br>
The new document you've created will contain example text and code below this -- delete it for a fresh start.

## Making Your First Slide
- Title your first slide using two # signs: <br> `## Insert Title Here`
- To make a slide without a title, use three asterisks:<br> `***`
- You can add subheadings with more # signs: <br>
`### Subheading` or `#### Smaller Subheading`
- To add a new slide, just add another Title: <br> `## New Slide Title`

## Adding Text
- Add bullet points to a slide using a hyphen followed by a space: <br>
`- bullet point`
- Add sub-points using four spaces and a plus sign:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`+ sub-point`
- Add an ordered list by typing the number/letter: <br>
`1. first point`<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`a) sub-sub-point`
- Add bullet points that appear one by one (on click) with:<br>
`>- iterated bullet point`

## Formatting Text
              Text                               Code in R Markdown
----------------------------------    ----------------------------------------
           plain text                              `plain text`  
           *italics*                               `*italics*`  
           **bold**                                `**bold**` 
  [link](http://www.jhsph.edu)          `[link](http://www.jhsph.edu)`  
          `verbatim code`                          ` `code here` `
 
## Embedding R Code
This is a chunk of R code in R Markdown:<br><br>
\`\`\`{r} <br>
`head(airquality)`<br>
\`\`\`  
The code gets run, and both the input and output are displayed.
```{r}
head(airquality)
```

## Embedding R Code
To hide the input code, use `echo=FALSE`.<br><br>
\`\`\`{r, echo=FALSE} <br>
`head(airquality)`<br>
\`\`\` 
```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(airquality)
```
This can be useful for showing plots.

## Embedding R Code
To show the input code only, use `eval=FALSE`.<br><br>
\`\`\`{r, eval=FALSE} <br>
`head(airquality)`<br>
\`\`\` 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(airquality)
```

## Embedding R Code
To run the code without showing input or output, use `include=FALSE`. <br><br>
\`\`\`{r, include=FALSE} <br>
`library(ggplot2)`<br>
\`\`\` 

## Generating Slideshows
- Click the **Knit** button at the top of the R Markdown document to generate your new document.
    + You may be asked to install required packages if you don't already have them installed -- hit "Yes" and RStudio will install them for you
- You can change the type of document generated by changing the `output` line in the header, or by selecting an output from the **Knit** button's pull-down menu.

## Generating Slideshows
- HTML: two options with different looks
    + `output: ioslides_presentation`
    + `output: slidy_presentation`
- PDF: `output: beamer_presentation`  
- Note: You can specify multiple outputs at the beginning of the R Markdown file if you will need to generate multiple filetypes. 

## PDFs and LaTeX
- To **knit** a PDF slideshow, you will need to install **LaTeX** on your computer
- LaTeX is a typesetting system that is needed to convert R Markdown into formatted text for PDFs

### Downloading and Installing LaTeX
- *LaTeX* is free
- LaTeX takes up a lot of space (almost ~2.6 GB download and takes up ~5 GB when installed)
- Visit [https://www.tug.org/begin.html](https://www.tug.org/begin.html) to download LaTeX for your operating system
- Depending on your internet connection, it may take a while to download due to its size

We recommend the following websites for sharing the HTML files that you produce from R Markdown documents. If you've taken The Data Scientist's Toolbox then you should be familiar with GitHub Pages. If you're familiar with Git and you haven't used it before their documentation for creating a site is very straightforward. If you're not familiar with Git and you're using RStudio you should take advantage of RPubs, which is perhaps the easiest way to share an HTML document from RStudio. You can find simple instructions for using RPubs here. If you're looking for a site that will host any HTML file for free, including HTML files that are generated by R Markdown, you should check out NeoCities. You'll need to provide links to HTML files you've created with R Makrdown in upcoming peer assessments, so make sure to familiarize yourself with one of these sites.
